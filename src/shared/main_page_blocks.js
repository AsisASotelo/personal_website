        comment: "I am Asis Sotelo, and this is my website. I enjoy simple design aesthetics so I modeled this after the website created by Jeremy Sallee. This website is relatively brand new but it is as good a starting point as any. I love solving problems and using computers. I love eating and making food. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara (Go Gauchos) with a degree in Physics. This page acts as a landing page that stores all pertinent information in my life. Throughout this website you can find links to projects, a blog (which still needs to be created), and hopefully more. You may contact me if you have any questions, feedback, say hello, by clicking my contact page. ",
